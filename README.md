# Auto TOR IP Changer

This script automates the process of setting up and using Tor to anonymize your traffic. The assigned IP from Tor will remain unchanged, providing consistent anonymity.

## Features
- Automatically installs required dependencies like `requests` and Tor.
- Starts the Tor service and uses the Tor SOCKS5 proxy.
- Displays the assigned IP address (remains unchanged unless you manually reload or restart the Tor service).
